Hey! I'm Danny. I'm really into programming language semantics, compiler development, and computer
architecture.

# About This Website
Before I developed this site, I considered using:

1. A Single-Page-Application Framework like React, **but** I prefered to use something smaller and
with as little Javascript as possible.

2. A Content Management System like WordPress, **but** these are too generic and non-customizable.
Choosing tools means managing the trade-off between abstraction and control.
These are too abstracted for my taste.

3. A Server-Side-Rendering Framework like Gatsby or Next, **but** see point #1.

I chose to make a statically generated site because it's simple, customizable, and less expensive than a CMS. Instead
of using Hugo or Jekyll, I opted for Roman Zolotarev's ssg5 because in 180 lines of shell code, it gets the job done.
